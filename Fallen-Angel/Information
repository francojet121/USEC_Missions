Replayable Mission

Helicopter shot down at a random location on map.  Only a very large generic area is "known" (eg: en route to Kavala might imply a 3-5km wide corridor stretching from the airbase to kavala)

Mission task is to locate the site, fight your way to it, (hopefully) save the survivors, and destroy the helicopter.
May include optional task such as recovering cargo or 'crypto module' that has requirements such as:
  a. Need a transport truck at site to haul gear
  b. Specialist needed to remove item
  c. Time delays (eg: 5 minutes till module removed)
---------------

1) Generate crash site.
  a. Helicopter or C17 if you feel like being different
  b. Spawn for 4-8 survivors of the crash.  Maybe a 10-20 minute delay before the survivors are active
  c. Short range radios only.  You want communications to be bad.  
  
2) Enemy patrols around the area.  

3) Friendly Resources
  a. Depends on mission variant.
    i.  "Light" - AI will be ground mobile with infantry and light vehicles only.
    ii. "Heavy" - AI will be equipped with air and heavy assets
  b. Friendlies should be primarily ground mobile where possible.  Air for light transport/CAS only.
    i.  Scenarios should work where landing nearby the wreck is difficult and/or highly dangerous.  They other helo did get shot down...
  c. If it takes a while for the ground teams to get there...tough luck.  Use heliopters to get a few teams in close for initial security.  
    
4) Win Conditions
  a.  Return downed crew to main base
  b.  Recover "crypto module" from wreck (some time-in-area based requirement for rescuers)
  c.  Destroy wreck.
    i.  If condition b is not possible, destroying the wreck counts as a partial win
